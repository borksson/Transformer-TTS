/Users/borkson/Code/School/CS474/Transformer-TTS/env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/autograd/__init__.py:200: UserWarning: The operator 'aten::sgn.out' is not currently supported on the MPS backend and will fall back to run on the CPU. This may have performance implications. (Triggered internally at /Users/runner/work/pytorch/pytorch/pytorch/aten/src/ATen/mps/MPSFallback.mm:11.)
